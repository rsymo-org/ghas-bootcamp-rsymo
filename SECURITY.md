# Security Policy

This section is copied from the OWASP Juice Shop as an example of a security policy.
OWASP Juice Shop is an _intentionally vulnerable_ web application, but we still do not want to be suprised by zero day
vulnerabilities which are not part of our hacking challenges. We are following the proposed Internet
standard <https://securitytxt.org> so you can find our
"security" policy in any running instance of the application at the expected location described in
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-06>. Finding it is actually one of our hacking challenges!


## Supported Versions
